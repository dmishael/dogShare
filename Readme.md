The Dog Share app allows dog owners to post when going out of town if they need a sitter. When they return they can look at all of the appointments and sign up to be a sitter. 
If I had more time I would have liked to add exit tickets to review both the owner and the sitter. I also would have liked to add a log for both user and the sitter to show their upcoming sits and appointments.
