MVP:
The Ruff House app allows dog owners to post when going out of town when in need of a dog sitter. A dog owner can also sign up for other appointments. User's can choose to create a profile when signing in order to share they're information with the community. 

Stretch Goal:
If I had more time I would have added exit tickets to for the owner to rate the sitter and the sitter to rate the dog during an appointment. I also would have added a log for both the user and the sitter to show their upcoming sits and appointments.
